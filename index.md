This working group brings Cornell social scientists working on policy issues with computational methods together to advance research projects, build interdisciplinary collaborations and facilitate professional development.

We anticipate that about half of the working group meetings will be informal sessions where working group members can share early works in progress. The remaining meetings will either be working paper presentations or workshops focused on introducing a computational skill/method. Stay tuned for more information!
